# Persistence
Allow players to change decorative blocks like doors, trapdoors, etc. and have the blocks return to their original state.

Set the name of your lobby world and the cooldowns for the supported blocks in the config file. Players will then be able to interact with the blocks and then the blocks will return to their previous state after the configured cooldown time.
